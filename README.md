# Rust for everyone

This series of exercises will closely follow the book : [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Challenge
While there are numerous excellent learning resources for Rust, we have recognized the need for more hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding of the concepts and help you become familiar with Rust.

## Exercises
These exercises are designed to bridge the gap, ensuring you not only grasp the theory but also gain practical experience to confidently apply what you've learned in the exciting world of Rust.
Each chatpers contains some well-commented starter code, and some todo!() macros that you are required to replace with your solutions.
Each chapter will feature multiple exercises categorized by difficulty levels, along with a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQ). We recommend that you start with level 0 and progress through the levels.
- [Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts](https://github.com/Asamartino/Rust_for_everyone/tree/main/src/chapter_3)

You can gauge your progress by running the tests associated with each level of exercises.
```sh
# Run the unit tests of chapter 3 level 0
cargo test chapter_3_level_0
```
The only requirement is that the tests must pass.

## Next steps
We will produce a video as soon as possible, allowing you to learn some valuable tricks as well :)

If you believe there are exercises that would be valuable additions or if you wish to propose changes, please do not hesitate to submit a pull request.
