# Rust for everyone

This series of exercises will closely follow the book : [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

While the learning materials offer valuable insights, we've recognized the need for more hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding of the concepts and familiarize yourself with Rust. 

These exercises are designed to bridge the gap, ensuring you not only grasp the theory but also gain practical experience to confidently apply what you've learned in the exciting world of Rust.

Each chapter will feature multiple exercises categorized by difficulty levels, along with a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQ). We recommend that you start with level 0 and progress through the levels.
