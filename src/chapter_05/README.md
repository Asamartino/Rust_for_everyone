## Chapter 4

The exercises in this chapter assume that you have read the chapter 4 of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
Ideally, you should begin with the level 0 exercises and progressively move on to levels 1 and level 2.

Here is a brief explanation of the levels:

- level 0: beginner exercises to get you familiar with the Rust syntax
- level 1: easy exercises
- level 2: intermediate exercises. They combine multiple concepts together, you might need to look around for a solution (as you might not know some concepts)

The multiple choice questions (MCQ) can be taken at any time. We recommend that you do it without any external help.

You can gauge your progress by running the tests associated with each level of exercises.

```sh
# Run the unit tests of chapter 4 level 0
cargo test chapter_4_level_1
```

The only requirement is that the tests must pass.
