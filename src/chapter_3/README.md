## Chapter 3
The exercises in this chapter assume that you have read 'The Rust Programming Language.' Ideally, you should begin with the level 0 exercises and progressively move on to levels 1 and level 2.

Here is a brief explanation of the levels:
-  level 0: beginner exercises to get you familiar with the Rust syntax
-  level 1: easy exercises
-  level 2: intermediate exercises. They combine multiple concepts together, you might need to look around for a solution (as you might not know some concepts)
