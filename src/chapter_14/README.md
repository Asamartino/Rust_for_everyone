## Chapter 14

The exercises in this chapter assume that you have read the chapter 14 of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-00-more-about-cargo.html).
This chapter brings some key concepts that depending on your background might be hard to grasp at first. That is why there is a long list of exercises in order to help you master those concepts. 

Ideally, you should begin with the level 0 exercises and progressively move to the next levels.

Here is a brief explanation of the levels:

- level 0: beginner exercises to get you familiar with the Rust syntax
- level 1: easy exercises
- level 2: intermediate exercises. They might combine multiple concepts together, you might need to look around for a solution (as you might not know some concepts)

The multiple choice questions (MCQ) can be taken at any time. We recommend that you do it without any external help (internet, books, etc.)

You can gauge your progress by running the tests associated with each level of exercises.

```sh
# Run the unit tests of chapter 11 level 1
cargo test chapter_11_level_1
```

The only requirement is that the tests must pass.
